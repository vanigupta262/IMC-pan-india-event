# IMC Pan-India Event - Trading Game Simulation

A multiplayer economic strategy game engine where bots representing countries compete by trading, building roads, attacking, and managing their economies.

## 🎮 Overview

This is a turn-based simulation where multiple countries (controlled by bots) interact through:
- **Trading** - Bilateral trade agreements that boost both economies
- **Building Roads** - Infrastructure that enhances trade efficiency
- **Attacking** - Raid connected countries to steal economy
- **Destroying Roads** - Break connections with other countries

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics

### Country Stats
- **Economy** - Starting value: 100.0 (main resource)
- **Defense** - Reduces attack damage (max: 1.0)
- **Manufacturing** - Production capability (max: 1.0)

### Actions

| Action | Type | Requirement | Effect |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| **TRADE** | Bilateral | Both must agree | Both gain economy (10% of min economy, 5% if no road) |
| **BUILD** | Bilateral | Both must agree | Creates road, costs 20% of min economy each |
| **ATTACK** | Unilateral | Road must exist | Steals economy based on defender's economy & defense, destroys road |
| **DESTROY** | Unilateral | Road must exist | Removes road immediately |

### Resolution Order
1. **Destroy** - Roads are removed first
2. **Attack** - Attacks processed (road destroyed after)
3. **Trade** - Mutual trades resolved
4. **Build** - New roads constructed
5. **Decay** - Stat decay applied

## 🤖 Bot Interface

Each bot receives a state dictionary and returns a list of actions:

### Input State
```python
state = {
    "self_id": int,           # Your country ID
    "round": int,             # Current round number
    "countries": {
        id: {
            "economy": float,
            "defense": float,
            "manufacturing": float
        }
    },
    "roads": [(i, j), ...]    # Existing roads
}
```

### Bot Output
```python
# Return a list of action dictionaries
[
    {"type": "TRADE", "target": 1},
    {"type": "BUILD", "target": 2},
    {"type": "ATTACK", "target": 3},
    {"type": "DESTROY", "target": 4}
]
```

## 🚀 Running a Match

```bash
python runner/local_match.py
```

This runs a 3-round match with 10 players and outputs results to `match_log.json`.

## 📊 Configuration

Edit `engine/config.py` to adjust game parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `N_PLAYERS` | 10 | Number of countries |
| `START_ECONOMY` | 100.0 | Initial economy |
| `ATTACK_FACTOR` | 0.4 | Attack damage multiplier |
| `DEFENSE_FACTOR` | 0.85 | Defense effectiveness |
| `ROAD_BUILD_COST` | 0.2 | Cost to build roads (% of min economy) |
| `TRADE_POOL_FACTOR` | 0.1 | Trade gain (% of min economy) |
| `AIR_TRADE_PENALTY` | 0.5 | Penalty for trading without road |

## 📝 Creating a Bot

1. Create a new file in `bots/` directory
2. Implement a `PM(state)` function that returns actions
3. Update the import in `runner/local_match.py`

Example minimal bot:
```python
def PM(state):
    self_id = state["self_id"]
    # Trade with the next player
    target = (self_id + 1) % len(state["countries"])
    return [{"type": "TRADE", "target": target}]
```

## 🖥️ Replay UI (React/Vite)

A simple read-only viewer to inspect match logs generated by the engine. Lives at `ui/replay-ui`.

### Prerequisites
- Node 20.19+ or 22.x (recommended). Check: `node -v`

### Setup
```bash
cd ui/replay-ui
npm install
```

### Running the replay UI (dev)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open the printed localhost URL. The app fetches a static JSON at `/data/match_log.json`.

### Providing match_log.json to the UI
- The UI reads from `ui/replay-ui/public/data/match_log.json`.
- To reuse the latest engine output, copy or generate the file there.

Example:
```bash
# From project root, after running the local match
cp match_log.json ui/replay-ui/public/data/match_log.json
```

### What you’ll see
- Round selector
- Actions per round
- Country economies after each round

### Troubleshooting
- If you see "Loading match...", ensure `/data/match_log.json` exists and is valid JSON under `public/data`.
- If the dev server is 404-ing `/data/match_log.json`, confirm the path is exactly `ui/replay-ui/public/data/match_log.json`.
- If rendering fails on empty rounds, restart the dev server after updating the JSON.

## 🔁 Full Trial Run (Engine → Replay UI)

1) Run a local match to produce a log
```bash
python runner/local_match.py
```
This writes `match_log.json` at repo root and prints round summaries.

2) Load the log in the UI
```bash
cp match_log.json ui/replay-ui/public/data/match_log.json
cd ui/replay-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

3) Open the dev URL and navigate rounds. You should see:
- Round actions from engine serialization (`runner/serialize.py`)
- Country economies after each round (`engine/resolver.py`)
